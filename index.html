						<p> Hey there! I'm a French girl from New York City. Currently studying at ESSEC Business School in Paris, I love to spend my free time learning new things, hanging out with friends, and discovering new places. I love foreign cinema, and am also very passionate about the Japanese culture. </p>

							<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
							<p>I was born in Paris, France, in 2001. My parents brought me to London when I was 1 month old, and that's where I spent the first 3 years of my life. I moved back to France for some years, until 2010. This time, my whole family was headed to New York City, USA. And what was supposed to be a short-term ordeal soon turned into a 10-years (and counting!) experience. In summer of 2019, I left my family to follow my studies at ESSEC.</p>

							<h2>Languages</h2>
							<p> I love learning foreign languages. I am fluent in French and in English, and I have been learning Spanish for 8 years. I have also been studying Japanese for 4, and have just begun learning Italian. </p>

						<h2>Japan</h2>
						<p> Ever since I can remember, I have been in love with Japan and its culture. Four years ago, I decided to teach myself the language to become even closer to the Land of the Rising Sun. I had the amazing oportunity to travel there twice. I am also very proud to be a part of <i>ESSEC Japon</i>, a student-led association highlighting the various apsects of the Japanese culture. </p>
